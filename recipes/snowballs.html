    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of sugar</li>
        <li>3 cups of large rolled oates</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of melted butter</li>
        <li>1 & 1/4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup of unsweetened fine coconut</li>
        <li>12 tbsp cocoa</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>In a large saucepan, combine and boil together
       gently over medium high heat for 5 minutes or 
       until mixture reaches about 230 degrees F on a 
       candy thermometer:</p>
       <ol>
           <li>3 cups of sugar</li>
           <li>3/4 cup of melted butter</li>
           <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Once mixture begins to boil it is very important not to stir it 
    at all.</p>
    <p>mix together</p>
        <ol>
            <li>3 cups of large rolled oates</li>
            <li>1 cup of unsweetened fine coconut</li>
            <li>12 tbsp cocoa</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Add the boiled mixture to the dry ingredients until
        well combined and chill until mixture is able to 
        be shaped into 1 1/2 inch balls. Roll the balls in
        additional coconut. Makes about 4 dozen. 
        These freeze very well.</p>
