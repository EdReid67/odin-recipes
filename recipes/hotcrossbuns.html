   <p>Ready right out of the oven</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
        <li>1 cup scalded milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 package dry or compressed yeast</li>
        <li>3 1/4 cup sifted flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>egg, well beaten</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup raisins</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in milk, 
            which has been scalded and cooled to lukewarm.</li> 
        <li>Add 1 1/2 cups flour and beat until smooth.</li> 
        <li>Cover and let rise in a warm place until light about 1 hour.</li> 
        <li>Cream butter and sugar</li> 
        <li>Add well beaten egg and salt. Add these to above 
            and then blend in floured raisins and the remaining 
            flour to form a soft dough.</li>
            <p>Knead lightly on a board; place in a greased 
            bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until 
            double in bulk about 2 hours. Then shape with 
            hands into medium-sized round buns; place in well 
            greased pans about 2â€³ apart. Cover and let rise 
            about 1 hour. Glaze top with egg diluted with water. 
            Use a sharp knife to cut a cross in the top of each bun. 
            Bake at 400F for 15 to 20 minutes. Just before removing 
            from the oven, brush the tops with sugar moistened with
            water. While hot, fill the cross with plain frosting.</p>
